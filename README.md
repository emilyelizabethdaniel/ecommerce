# ECOMMERCE DATABASE

## Description
This database is intended so serve as a way to store ecommerce data, with Category sections to seperate products by their categories (ie: jeans, etc), Product sections for specific Products (ie: blue flair high rise jeans, with price, stock and category listed), and Tags to designate different attributes (ie: vintage, with the specific product id and tag ids).

## Usage
This database can not only store, but allows the user to search by category, product or tags to find specific items. These categories, products and tags can also be searched by their unique ids, updated by their unique ids, and deleted by their unique ids, and allows new categories, products and tags to be added to the database.
